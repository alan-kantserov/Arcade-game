# Overview
In this project, I supposed to clone an arcade game in HTML5. I was provided with all the visual assets and a game loop engine. Using this tools I supposed to add some entities to this game - player and enemies characters.

# Game development
To accomplish that, I needed to create Player and Enemy objects in 'app.js' in order to implement basic rules to their movements. In addition, this game supposes to take user's keypress and execute using them as an argument.

# Future plans
In the future, I will definetely update this game, implementing some useful features like score, different skins, new levels, gameplay and sounds.
